# Components

This directory contains React components used to build the application interface.

## Organization

- **ui/**: Low-level, reusable design system components (buttons, inputs, cards).
- **Root level**: Domain-specific components (e.g., `AlertCard.tsx`, `Sidebar.tsx`, `IncidentFilters.tsx`).

These components are composed together to build the `pages`.
