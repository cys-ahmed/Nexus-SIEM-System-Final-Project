# Public Assets

Static assets that are served directly by the web server.

## Contents

- **Images**: Application logos and profile placeholders.
- **robots.txt**: Search engine crawler directives.
- **index.html**: The main HTML entry point (in some build setups, though Vite usually keeps it in root).

Files in this directory are mapped to the root path `/` during deployment.
